# GRAPH-ALGORITHMS
## lab work for graph algorithms
### labs:
*lab1: Design and implement an abstract data type directed graph and a function (either a member function or an external one, as your choice) for reading a directed graph from a text file.The vertices will be specified as integers from 0 to n-1, where n is the number of vertices.
  Edges may be specified either by the two endpoints (that is, by the source and target), or by some abstract data type Edge_id (that data type may be a pointer or reference to the edge representation, but without exposing the implementation details of the graph).
  Additionally, create a map that associates to an edge an integer value (for instance, a cost).*



*lab2: Ex 4. Write a program that finds the connected components of an undirected graph using a breadth-first traversal of the graph.*



*lab3: Ex 6. Write a program that, given a graph with costs and two vertices, finds a lowest cost walk between the given vertices, or prints a message if there are negative cost cycles in the graph. The program shall use the matrix multiplication algorithm.*



*lab4: Ex 6. Write a program that, given an undirected connected graph, constructs a minumal spanning tree using the Prim's algorithm.*



*lab5: Ex 3. Given an undirected graph, find a vertex coloring with minimum number of colors.*
